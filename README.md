âœ… Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

**Expected Behavior:**

- **If the file exists**: The program will display each line of
-    `sample.txt` one by one.
- **If the file does not exist**: An appropriate error message like
-    `"Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found."` will be displayed instead of crashing.

ðŸ“„ **Script:** `read_file.py`

âœ… Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

**Problem Statement:**
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named
2.    `output.txt`.
3. Appends additional user input to the same file.
4. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

**Expected Behavior:**

- The script first collects input from the user and writes it to the file.
- It then prompts the user for additional data and appends it.
- Finally, it reads and prints the content of `output.txt`.
