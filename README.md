Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

File: factorial.py

Description:
This Python program defines a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop. The function takes a number as input, validates it, and returns the factorial. The program then calls the function with a sample number (e.g., 5) and prints the result.

Features:


Input validation to ensure the number is non-negative.



Uses a loop to compute the factorial.



Handles edge cases (e.g., factorial of 0 is 1).

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

File: math_calculations.py

Description:
This Python program prompts the user to input a number and uses the math module to calculate the following:





Square root of the number



Natural logarithm (base e) of the number



Sine of the number (in radians)

The program includes error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers for logarithm or square root) and displays the results.

Features:





User input for a number.



Uses math.sqrt(), math.log(), and math.sin() from the math module.



Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input or negative numbers for certain calculations).
